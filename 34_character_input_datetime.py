# Implement the same exercise as Exercise 1 (Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age. Print out a message addressed to them that tells them the year that they will turn 100 years old), except donâ€™t explicitly write out the year. Use the built-in Python datetime library to make the code you write work during every year, not just the one we are currently in.
