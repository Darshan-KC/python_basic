# In this exercise, the task is to write a function that picks a random word from a list of words from the SOWPODS dictionary. Download this file and save it in the same directory as your Python code. This file is Peter Norvigâ€™s compilation of the dictionary of words used in professional Scrabble tournaments. Each line in the file contains a single word.
import random

def readFromFile(file,line):
    with open(file,"r") as f:
        for i in range(line+1):
            if(i == line):
                return f.readline().strip()
            f.readline()
    return None

def countLines(file):
    count = 0
    with open(file,"r") as f:
        for i in f:
            count += 1
    return count

if __name__ == "__main__":
    file = "sowpods.txt"
    n = countLines(file)
    m = random.randint(0,n)
    print(f"Random word is {readFromFile(file,m)}")
