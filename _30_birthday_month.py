# In the previous exercise we saved information about famous scientistsâ€™ names and birthdays to disk. In this exercise, load that JSON file from disk, extract the months of all the birthdays, and count how many scientists have a birthday in each month.

# Your program should output something like:

# {
# 	"May": 3,
# 	"November": 2,
# 	"December": 1
