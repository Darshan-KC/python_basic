# Write a password generator in Python. Be creative with how you generate passwords - strong passwords have a mix of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. The passwords should be random, generating a new password every time the user asks for a new password. Include your run-time code in a main method.

# Extra:

# Ask the user how strong they want their password to be. For weak passwords, pick a word or two from a list.
