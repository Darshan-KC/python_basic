# Let’s continue building Hangman. In the game of Hangman, a clue word is given by the program that the player has to guess, letter by letter. The player guesses one letter at a time until the entire word has been guessed. (In the actual game, the player can only guess 6 letters incorrectly before losing).

# Let’s say the word the player has to guess is “EVAPORATE”.

# >>> Guess your letter: S
# Incorrect!
# >>> Guess your letter: E
# E _ _ _ _ _ _ _ E
