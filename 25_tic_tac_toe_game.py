# built up a few components needed to build a Tic Tac Toe game in Python:

# Draw the Tic Tac Toe game board
# Checking whether a game board has a winner
# Handle a player move from user input
# The next step is to put all these three components together to make a two-player Tic Tac Toe game! Your challenge in this exercise is to use the functions from those previous exercises all together in the same program to make a two-player game that you can play with a friend
