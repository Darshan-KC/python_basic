# In the previous exercise we counted how many birthdays there are in each month in our dictionary of birthdays.

# In this exercise, use the bokeh Python library to plot a histogram of which months the scientists have birthdays in! Because it would take a long time for you to input the months of various scientists, you can use my scientist birthday JSON file. Just parse out the months (if you donâ€™t know how, I suggest looking at the previous exercise or its solution) and draw your histogram.
